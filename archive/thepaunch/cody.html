<h2>Cody</h2>
<b>Class:</b> 2006<p>
<b>Major:</b> Computer Science <p>
<b>Hometown:</b> Southlake, TX <p>
<b>Occupation:</b> Assassin <p>
<b>Other stuff you do for fun:</b> Make Fruit Paunch's
website exist, Beta Theta Pi,
Klaritin Improv Ensemble, writing my little face off<p>
<b>Anything else you want to say:</b> Call me <em>Cody the Destroyer</em>,
please.  Also, if you're into long-form improv give a looksy to Columbia's other
group, <a href="http://klaritin.kicks-ass.org">Klaritin</a>.<p>
<b>Were you raised by bears?:</b>
I staunchly deny any allegation that I watched <em>Care Bears</em> or <em>Gummi
Bears</em> as a child.  Or had the plush toys.<p>
<b>What is your favorite beverage to enjoy on Friday at 12:03PM?:</b><br>Tab, of
course.<p>

<b>and then the body of your bio:</b> Cajoled into updating the Paunch website
by Carly Hoogendyk's promises of money, extreme hugs, and Tab, Cody
accomplished a miracle of Columbia beauracracy by making a web site exist in a
mere two
days.  Mad with power he went on to mess up the fruitpaunch{at}columbia.edu
email
alias and add his own bio to the Paunch website merely because he was reminded
of the best quote ever yesterday and he wants it to appear near his name.<p>
<b>Quote:</b><br>
I'm in love with my life and I'm sticking to it - I mean the belief in
it. I may be a distracted wretch but I am still a man and I know how to fight
and survive, I have before. Gods, if not help me, if instead barb me, be careful
of me, I can catch thunderbolts and pull you down and have done it before.
Adieu!<br/>
--Jack Kerouac, <em>Visions of Cody</em> (that's me)
