<b>Quote:</b> Head to the bank to make a few transactions, bust a Ben
frank to get some Andrew Jacksons.  Five twenties for a hundred
dollar bill; You know the math, let's make a deal. On the one dollar
bill, if you look on the front, you'll find the face of George
Washington.  Make money, baby that's all I do.  That's how I know
Thomas Jefferson is on the two.  Abraham Lincoln got shot and died;
Freed the slaves, so they put him on the five.  And Hamilton, my old
time friend, they put his face on the front of the ten.  These are
the dead presidents, from the hood and they represent.  -  Too
